-------------------

The birdhouse website is on http://bird-house.github.io/.
The HTML pages are `maintained on GitHub <https://github.com/bird-house/bird-house.github.io>`_.


Documentation

The documentation is created with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_
and is automatically published to `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ with GitHub webhooks.

The main `documentation`_ (which you are reading now) is the starting point to
get an overview of what birdhouse provides. Each birdhouse component comes with
its own Sphinx documentation and is referenced by the main birdhouse document.
