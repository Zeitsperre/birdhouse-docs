Contributing
============

The Birdhouse project openly welcomes contributions
(bug reports, bug fixes, code enhancements/features, etc.).
This document will outline some guidelines on contributing to birdhouse.
As well, the birdhouse :ref:`community` is a great place to get an idea of
how to connect and participate in birdhouse community and development.
